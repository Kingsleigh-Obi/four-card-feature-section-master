## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Centering a div within another div: I discovered that this can be done by setting margin-left and margin-right to auto

- Css Positioning: I learnt about the values of the position property and how to use them. For example, the position: relative causes the div to be moved without affecting the subsequent divs. For instance If i set the margin of one div, this affects other divs below it, the position property can help eliminate that.



```html
<div>go</div>
<div>stay</div>


### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on css grid
